### About The Project:

This project contains 5 different logic games implemented in Python. Each game is a command-line program that prompts the user 
with a question and expects a response.

The games are:
* brain-even: Answer whether a given number is even or not
* brain-calc: Calculate the result of a given arithmetic expression
* brain-gcd: Find the greatest common divisor of two given numbers
* brain-progression: Find the missing number in a given arithmetic progression
* brain-prime: Answer whether a given number is prime or not

### Installation:

To install and run the project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. To check if you have Python 3 installed, 
run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python3 --version
```
To install the project, you can clone the repository from GitHub:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:DariaChadina/python-project-49.git
```

### Usage

To play one of the games, you can navigate to the project directory and run the corresponding command. For example, to play the 
brain-even game, you can run the following command:
```sh
python3 -m brain_even
```
Similarly, you can run the following commands to play the other games:

* brain-calc: python3 -m brain_calc
* brain-gcd: python3 -m brain_gcd
* brain-progression: python3 -m brain_progression
* brain-prime: python3 -m brain_prime
